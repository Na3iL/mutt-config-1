# Mutt

This I my mutt configuration.

I use two accounts, one gmail the other gmx. I keep them synced to a 
local maildir via offlineimap and do my sending for either account via 
msmtprc. Examples files for these two tools are present.

I also use folder hooks to set up any account-specific settings when you 
navigate to a directory for that account.

My muttrc is setup to feel a bit more like gmail when it comes to 
sorting and threading. There are also some useful keybinds and coloring.

I use uber-mutt which is basically mutt with the sidebar-patch and a 
forgotten-attachment patch. It is on the AUR.

Be sure to `man muttrc` for anything you don't understand.
